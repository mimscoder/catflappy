Heavily inspired by "Flappy Bird," I created "Cat Flappy" to demonstrate touch interaction mechanics, specifically progressive hold duration controls. 
DragGesture used to lift the cat:
  Tap: Touch down + immediate lift = brief hold duration
  Hold: Touch down + sustained contact = progressive power buildup
  Drag: Touch down + movement = still treated as hold (movement ignored)
Built as an educational tool for exploring touch states and gesture-based user interfaces.
